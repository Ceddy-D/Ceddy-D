- Welcome to Salience: Worldbuilding Generator!
- The plan is to make a single .exe file that designs whatever you may need for your creative spirit!
- Character Names, character descriptions, countries, battles, planets, materials, etc, all randomly generated.
- As you can already guess, I use win32 API and make little to no attempt to make it portable. Sorry Club Penguin users.
- Suggestions encouraged!

- All the best,
